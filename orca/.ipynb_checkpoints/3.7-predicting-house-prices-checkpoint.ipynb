    "## Preparing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be problematic to feed into a neural network values that all take wildly different ranges. The network might be able to automatically adapt to such heterogeneous data, but it would definitely make learning more difficult. A widespread best practice to deal with such data is to do feature-wise normalization: for each feature in the input data (a column in the input data matrix), we will subtract the mean of the feature and divide by the standard deviation, so that the feature will be centered around 0 and will have a unit standard deviation. We can directly use the numbers calculated above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fit the data into Orca Estimator\n",
    "To fit the data with Orca estimator, we will need to create two data creator functions that transform the training data and test data into `tf.data.Dataset`. The function takes in one argument `config`, which is a dictionary where we can put in necessary information, such as mean and standard deviation of training set and the batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validating our approach using K-fold validation\n",
    "To evaluate our network while we keep adjusting its parameters (such as the number of epochs used for training), we could simply split the data into a training set and a validation set, as we were doing in our previous examples. However, because we have so few data points, the validation set would end up being very small (e.g. about 100 examples). A consequence is that our validation scores may change a lot depending on which data points we choose to use for validation and which we choose for training, i.e. the validation scores may have a high variance with regard to the validation split. This would prevent us from reliably evaluating our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best practice in such situations is to use K-fold cross-validation. It consists of splitting the available data into K partitions (typically K=4 or 5), then instantiating K identical models, and training each one on K-1 partitions while evaluating on the remaining partition. The validation score for the model used would then be the average of the K validation scores obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of code, this is straightforward."
