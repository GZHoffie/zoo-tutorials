However, because we have so few data points, the validation set would end up being very small (e.g. about 100 examples). A consequence is that our validation scores may change a lot depending on which data points we choose to use for validation and which we choose for training, i.e. the validation scores may have a high variance with regard to the validation split. This would prevent us from reliably evaluating our model.\n",

    "* When there is little data available, using K-Fold validation is a great way to reliably evaluate a model.\n",
